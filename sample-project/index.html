    <div class="discription-line-1"> Aws DevOps project has been successfully setup</div>
    <div class="discription-line-2">Your HTML app is successfully up and running on Aws</div>

    <div>
      <div>View your CI/CD pipeline on Mercurial services and  customize it as per your needs</div>
      <div>View your service stack in AWS Portal</div>
    </div>
